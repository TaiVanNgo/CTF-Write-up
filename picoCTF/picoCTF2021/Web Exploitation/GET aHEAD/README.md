In this challenge, I checked on the two buttons, the red one is `GET` method, the blue one is `POST` method. I noiticed to the title of the challenge, it is GET aHEAD, so I used Burp Suite to change the method to `HEAD` instead of `GET` or `POST`.

Send to repeater, then in the `repeater` tab, modify the request to `HEAD` and send it.
