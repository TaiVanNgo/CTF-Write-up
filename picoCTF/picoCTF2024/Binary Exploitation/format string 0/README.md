In this challenge, the challenge is about the [format string vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack#:~:text=The%20Format%20String%20is%20the,conversion%20of%20the%20format%20function.)

When we read the source code, `choice1` and `choice2` are being passed as the format string to `printf()`

`int count = printf(choice1);`

`printf(choice2);`

This causes some unexpected error when the user type in with some `%s` and `%d`. So to get the flag, we just chose the input that have these characters, when the program is cracked due to the Segmentation Fault (SIGSEGV), it returns flag


FLAG: picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_a1d85b3e}
