Every file has a unique checksum that you can use to ensure its integrity. In other words, you can verify the fileâ€™s checksum to ensure the file you downloaded is exactly the file you want and that it was not corrupted or modified in any way.
SHA-256 is a name for one of the hash algorithms you can use to generate a checksum.

# What you need to remember
There are two things you need to remember while generating checksums of our files:
All checksums in Rublon Downloads are generated using the SHA-256 algorithm. If you use a different algorithm to generate your checksum, e.g. SHA 1, it will produce a different result. Always generate an SHA-256 checksum.
For checksums, capitalization does not matter, e.g. A and a are the same. These two strings are the same checksum:
`F7EFD7168F50FD6B574C1D948779AC1CC3D70AFCC95C5757FF82F57BFA06B194`
`f7efd7168f50fd6b574c1d948779ac1cc3d70afcc95c5757ff82f57bfa06b194`
